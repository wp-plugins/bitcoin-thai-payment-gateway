Woocommerce payment module for use with https://coinpay.in.th merchant accounts

== Description ==
NOTE: You must install the main "WooCommerce - excelling eCommerce" plugin in order to use this plugin

This module allows you to accept Bitcoin payments in Thailand via your https://coinpay.in.th merchant account

When users choose the "Bitcoin" payment option at the checkout they will be shown a bitcoin address to send their payment.  Once they have sent the Bitcoin payment they can click "Place Order" to complete the order.

Orders are accepted immediately and put as status "on-hold" until confirmations are received, then orders are automatically updated to "Completed"

* Note if you have been using the Bitcoin.co.th merchant service we have now migrated your account to CoinPay.in.th.  Please update to this module and use https://coinpay.in.th to check your account details
